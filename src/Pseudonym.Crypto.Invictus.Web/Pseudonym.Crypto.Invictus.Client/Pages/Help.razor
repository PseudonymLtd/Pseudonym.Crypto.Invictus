                <Answer>
                    <p>
                        This site is run by Pseudonym Ltd, which is a one man company run by <Link DisplayText="Tom Day" Url="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-day-684a0ba6" CaptionText="LinkedIn" />.
                        Tom participated in the <b>Crypto20</b> <small>ICO</small> making his debut investment in the crypto space.

                    <p>
                        In 2020, Tom took part in Invictus Capital's community developer program,
                        aiming to incentivize developers and tech savvy people alike in the space to make tools for the wider Invictus community.
                        This product is the result of that program.

            <Question Title="Why is the site sudddenly not working?" ShortAnswer="The site has probably updated. You should clear your cache.">
                <Answer>
                    <p>
                        This site is made using Blazor. For all of its technical greatness, its still pretty bad when it comes to updating our website.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you find the site suddenly stops working, it could be us! But before sending us a bug report, try the following:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Press F12 if you're on a desktop, or if on a tablet device or mobile, navigate to the developer tools section of your browser.</li>
                        <li>
                            If on desktop, a new pane will appear - click the "Application" tab and hit clear cache. This will clear the cache for this site.
                            <p>
                                <b>Note:</b> watch out for cookies - you probably want to uncheck any tick boxes that refer to clearing cookies, you'll want to keep them.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If you're using a mobile or tablet device, your browser may not have a "developer" mode. In this case, you'll have to clear your global cache.
                            <p>
                                To clear your global cache, you'll need to go into your settings, under the privacy section on your browser, there should be a clear method to clearing out your cache.

                    <p>
                        Data on this site is collected from a variety of sources to maintain data integrity. Most of this data is collected and then cached in our own storage systems.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span>Below is a list of current data sources:</span>
